# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.

# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
